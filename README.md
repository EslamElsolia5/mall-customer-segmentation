# Mall Customer Segmentation (K-Means) | Power BI + Python

## Business Objective
Identify customer segments within the mall and select the most targetable segments to increase Spending Score and improve marketing efficiency.

## Dataset
- Features: Customer_ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income (k$), Spending Score (1–100), cluster
- Source: Kaggle

## Methodology
1. Data preprocessing
2. K-Means clustering (k = 6)
3. Cluster profiling in Python (avg income, avg spending, age, cluster size)
4. Dashboarding in Power BI (Overview → Profiling → Target Segments)

## Targetable Segments
Targetable customers are those in clusters: 2, 4, 5
- Cluster 5: High Income / Low Spending (Upsell Opportunity)
- Cluster 4: Core Regulars (Mass Uplift)
- Cluster 2: Premium Potentials (High Income, Mid Spend)
